### Some points about the project report FA Automata:
- Introduction: The report begins with an introduction to finite automata (FAs), which are abstract computing devices that can be used to recognize patterns. FAs are made up of a finite set of states, a finite set of input symbols, and a transition function that determines how the states change as input symbols are read.
- Formal Definition: The report then provides a formal definition of FAs, including the different types of FAs, such as deterministic finite automata (DFAs) and non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs).
- Construction: The report then discusses how FAs can be constructed, and provides examples of how FAs can be used to recognize different patterns.
- Applications: The report then discusses the applications of FAs, such as their use in compiler design, natural language processing, and computer security.
- Exercises: The report concludes with a number of exercises that allow readers to test their understanding of FAs.

# Getting Started

The project report should be well-written and easy to understand. It should also be comprehensive and informative. The report should include all of the necessary information to help readers understand FAs and their applications.

# Installation and run

First, team leader needs to fork the project and then let your team members to clone your project.  
Run the following command:
```ruby
git clone https://github.com/Tito-com/automataProject
```

- `backlog`: List all tasks in one place
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `AUTOMATA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/topics/automata).
